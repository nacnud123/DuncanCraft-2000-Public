# DuncanCraft 2000

DuncanCraft 2000 is a Minecraft classic clone created in C# using OpenTK. It has fast infinite worlds, saving/loading, caves, blocks, bugs, and UI. This was created as a exploration of using no game enigne to make voxel games. Here you will find the latest build of the game along with the source code.
